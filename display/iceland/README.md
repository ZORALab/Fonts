# Iceland

The idea of geometric typefaces with a look reminiscent of the machinery,
technology, and interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile family by
Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).

Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal
character designed with the intention to perform well on screen starting from
low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and
diagonal cuts have a 45° angle, outlines are rounded.

Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better
legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid
readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp
impression.

Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the
old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from
lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.

Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland
webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.
